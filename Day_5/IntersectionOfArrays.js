/*
Assignment Details: 
Create a JavaScript program that defines a function to compute the intersection of two arrays. The 
intersection should include elements that appear in both arrays without any duplicates. 
 
Assignment Requirements: 
1. Write a function named `intersection` that accepts two arguments, `arr1` and `arr2`, which are 
arrays of numbers, and returns an array of their intersection. 
2. Ensure no duplicate elements in the resulting array. If an element appears in both `arr1` and 
`arr2`, it should appear only once in the result. 
3. Use a loop to find common elements. Iterate through each element of `arr1` and check if it is 
present in `arr2` and not already included in the result array. 
4. Include example calls to the `intersection` function with different arrays to demonstrate the 
function’s functionality. Include examples with no common elements, all elements common, and 
typical cases.

function intersection(arr1,arr2){
    let mergedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];
    let finalArray = [];
    mergedArray.forEach(element => { if (!finalArray.includes(element) ) {
        finalArray.push(element); 
        }});
    return finalArray;
}

console.log(intersection([1,2,3,4,3,4],[1,6,7,8,6]));
console.log(intersection([1,2,3],[1,2,3]));
console.log(intersection([1,2,3],[4,5,6]));
console.log(intersection([1,1,1,2,3],[1,2,2,3,4]));
